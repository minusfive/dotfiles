# Rslib Modern Package

Use this skill when creating a new Rslib library, modernizing an existing JS/TS package, or reviewing a package against an opinionated modern library standard.

This skill is opinionated: it describes a recommended modern package contract and may suggest breaking changes when they make the package simpler, safer, and easier for modern consumers.

## Standard

Default recommendation for new JS/TS libraries:

- ESM-first, preferably pure ESM.
- Strict TypeScript and correct declaration files.
- Explicit public API through `package.json#exports`.
- Small named-export API surface.
- Few runtime dependencies, without treating zero dependencies as a religion.
- Small, tree-shakeable output with accurate `sideEffects`.
- Clear dependency placement: runtime dependencies, peer dependencies, optional dependencies, and dev dependencies are not interchangeable.
- Published package is tested as an artifact, not just as source files.
- Release flow is automated, traceable, and SemVer-aware.
- README.md explains usage for humans; AGENTS.md preserves package invariants for future agents.

## Workflow

1. **Inspect the package contract first**
   - Read `package.json`, lockfile/package manager, `rslib.config.*`, `tsconfig*`, CI/release config, README.md, AGENTS.md, and existing `dist` output.
   - Identify package kind: Node utility, browser library, isomorphic utility, CLI, UI/component library, framework plugin, SDK, or adapter.
   - List supported runtimes, current entry points, deep imports, runtime dependencies, peer dependencies, optional integrations, files with side effects, and published files.
   - Run `npm pack --dry-run` early when changing package shape so the real tarball contents guide the review.

2. **Define target environments explicitly**
   - Do not say "supports modern environments" without defining them.
   - Verify the current Node.js release schedule before choosing `engines`.
   - As of May 9, 2026, Node.js 22 and 24 are LTS, and Node.js 20 is EOL. For new Node-facing packages, recommend `engines.node >=22` unless real consumers need an older runtime.
   - Browser packages should state whether they require native ESM, a bundler, Workers support, SSR compatibility, DOM APIs, CSS processing, or specific browser baselines.
   - Compatibility drops are breaking changes: old Node/browser versions, undocumented deep imports, default/named export shape, bundled vs external dependency behavior, and import side effects.

3. **Prefer pure ESM, but explain compatibility cost**
   - New packages should use `"type": "module"` and ESM source/output.
   - Rslib's default format is ESM; keep that default unless there is a clear reason to add another format.
   - Evaluate compatibility from real consumers and supported runtimes instead of assuming every historical module format is required.
   - Modern Node.js can load synchronous ESM from CommonJS via `require(esm)`; do not assume CJS consumers always require a separate CJS build.
   - If you rely on `require(esm)` compatibility, document and test its constraints: supported Node versions, no top-level `await` in the loaded graph, namespace-object return shape, default export behavior, and CJS/ESM cycle limits.
   - Prefer Node built-in specifiers such as `node:fs/promises`.

4. **Make `exports` the public API**
   - Treat `package.json#exports` as the product contract.
   - Export only paths users are meant to import.
   - Do not allow imports like `pkg/dist/foo.js` by exporting `./dist/*`. That makes the generated output layout part of the public API and turns internal file moves into breaking changes.
   - Instead, expose only intentional public paths such as `pkg` and `pkg/foo.js`, mapped to the actual files in `dist`.
   - Keep subpath style consistent: either all with extensions such as `./foo.js`, or all without extensions. Prefer paths with extensions when browser import maps matter.
   - Keep `"types"` first inside conditional exports.
   - Adding `exports` to an older package can be breaking because undeclared deep imports stop working.
   - Add `./package.json` only when consumers legitimately need package metadata.

5. **Design a small API surface**
   - Prefer named exports for multi-API packages.
   - Avoid default-export objects that gather every function into one object.
   - Public functions should be few, stable, well-named, and semver-maintained.
   - Keep internal types, caches, helper functions, adapter details, and error internals private unless they are part of the contract.
   - Avoid top-level work during import: file scans, network calls, timers, process mutation, global registration, DOM access, prototype mutation, or environment detection with side effects.
   - Async APIs that may be canceled should accept `AbortSignal`.
   - Prefer stable error classes, error codes, or typed error shapes over string matching.

6. **Use Rslib as the implementation path, not the whole standard**
   - For detailed Rslib configuration guidance, use the `rslib-best-practices` skill.
   - In this skill, only check whether Rslib output, declarations, `package.json#exports`, `files`, dependencies, and docs agree with the modern package contract.
   - Keep Rslib configuration small and intentional; avoid adding build complexity that does not improve the package contract.

7. **Keep dependencies small and intentional**
   - Start from platform APIs, not from dependency search.
   - Prefer built-ins when the runtime supports them: `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `Intl`, `fetch`, `AbortController`, `structuredClone`, `crypto.randomUUID`, Web Streams, `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `node:fs/promises`, and `node:crypto`.
   - Small runtime dependencies are fine when they reduce maintenance risk or implementation complexity.
   - Avoid large utility packages for one or two helpers.
   - Evaluate dependencies for ESM support, `exports`, types, transitive dependency count, package size, license, maintenance activity, security history, install scripts, side effects, native install fragility, and granular imports.
   - Put required runtime packages in `dependencies`.
   - Put host-owned frameworks and toolchains in `peerDependencies`, such as React, Vue, Svelte, Rspack, Rsbuild, webpack, TypeScript, and framework runtimes.
   - Keep peer ranges reasonably broad; do not pin peers to a patch version unless required.
   - Put build tools, test tools, type tools, docs tools, and Rsbuild/Rspack plugins in `devDependencies`.
   - Use `optionalDependencies` or optional peers via `peerDependenciesMeta` for optional integrations.

8. **Make TypeScript strict and package-oriented**
   - Prefer TypeScript source for TS libraries; otherwise use high-quality JSDoc plus generated declarations.
   - With TypeScript 6 or tsgo-era defaults, strict checking may already be enabled; preserve that default and do not turn it off. For older TypeScript versions or inherited configs, set `strict: true` explicitly.
   - In Rslib projects, consider enabling `lib.dts.tsgo` to speed up declaration generation when the project can use tsgo.
   - Keep `module` and `moduleResolution` aligned with how declarations are emitted and how consumers resolve the package; NodeNext and bundler-style resolution are both valid in the right toolchain.
   - Use `verbatimModuleSyntax` so type-only imports/exports are explicit.
   - Use `isolatedDeclarations` when practical so exported APIs are explicit enough for declaration-oriented tooling.
   - Emit declarations; use declaration maps when editor navigation matters.
   - Use `import type` and `export type` for type-only dependencies.
   - Do not rely on consumers setting `skipLibCheck` to hide broken package types.
   - Test declarations as consumers see them, especially when using subpath exports.

9. **Keep `sideEffects` accurate**
   - Use `sideEffects: false` only when importing package files has no top-level side effects.
   - If CSS, polyfills, registrations, global listeners, prototype changes, or other import-time mutations exist, list the files with side effects instead.
   - Do not set `sideEffects: false` just to improve bundle size; incorrect values can remove required CSS or setup code.
   - Do not change globals just because a file is imported. If setup is required, expose an explicit `setup()` or `install()` function and let users call it themselves.

10. **Make `package.json` authoritative**
    - Required modern shape: `"type": "module"`, explicit `exports`, correct declarations, `files` allowlist, accurate `sideEffects`, sensible `engines`, and release scripts.
    - Include README.md, AGENTS.md, and LICENSE in `files` when they exist.
    - `files` should prevent tests, fixtures, private docs, build caches, local configs, and large generated artifacts from leaking into the tarball.
    - Avoid stale `main`/`module` fields unless compatibility evidence requires them; if kept, they must agree with `exports`.
    - Keep runtime dependency fields accurate. A package that works locally only because a runtime dependency is in `devDependencies` is broken.

11. **Validate the published artifact**
    - Run normal lint, typecheck, tests, and `rslib build`.
    - Smoke test built ESM output.
    - Run type-level tests when the public API is type-heavy.
    - Run `npm pack --dry-run` and inspect included files.
    - In Rslib, prefer `rsbuild-plugin-publint` to run publint after build; use `npx publint` as a CLI fallback.
    - In Rslib, prefer `rsbuild-plugin-arethetypeswrong` to run Are The Types Wrong after build when declarations are shipped; use `npx --yes @arethetypeswrong/cli --pack .` as a CLI fallback.
    - Install the packed tarball into clean consumer fixtures for important packages.
    - Test ESM import, bundler import for browser/component libraries, CLI execution for `bin` packages, and every public subpath export.

12. **Prepare README.md and AGENTS.md before publishing**
    - Always check whether both files exist before publishing or modernizing a package.
    - If either file is missing, recommend adding it; for implementation tasks, create a concise version unless I ask not to.
    - README.md should include: package name, one-sentence purpose, install/usage, key features or API links, supported environments, docs/related links, changelog or contribution link, and license.
    - AGENTS.md should include: stack, package contract, common commands, source layout, code style, validation commands, and release checklist.
    - Keep both files synchronized with `package.json#exports`, supported runtimes, and actual Rslib output.

13. **Publish with supply-chain hygiene**
    - Follow SemVer and document breaking changes.
    - Maintain a changelog for user-visible changes.
    - Use prerelease versions and dist-tags for beta/next channels.
    - Prefer CI publishing with npm provenance or trusted publishing.
    - Avoid long-lived publish tokens where trusted publishing is available.
    - Remember that a published package name/version pair cannot be reused safely.

## Review Red Flags

- `exports` is missing, points to files not emitted by Rslib, or allows public imports such as `pkg/dist/foo.js`.
- `module`/`main` fields disagree with `exports`.
- Type declarations do not match runtime entry points.
- Runtime dependency is accidentally listed only in `devDependencies`.
- React/Vue/Svelte/Rspack/Rsbuild/webpack/TypeScript is bundled or placed in `dependencies` when it should be a peer.
- `sideEffects: false` is set while importing CSS, polyfills, global registrations, global listeners, or prototype changes.
- Package has install scripts without a strong reason.
- Top-level import reads user files, starts timers, touches the network, mutates globals, or assumes `window`/`process`.
- Published tarball contains private source maps, tests/fixtures that are not useful to consumers, large generated docs, local config secrets, or build caches.
