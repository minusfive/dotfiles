# Agent Instructions Authoring

Use this skill for any task that creates, edits, audits, or restructures files that instruct agent behavior. This includes skills (`SKILL.md`), top-level instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, repo-level agent docs), subagent and agent definitions, and any other rule/instruction entry point.

Required upstream references are listed alongside the work they govern: see [Skill Authoring](#skill-authoring) for skill schema/structure references and [AGENTS.md Authoring](#agentsmd-authoring) for top-level instruction-file references. Load them when the task scope warrants; for small edits (description rewrites, wording tweaks, index updates, typo fixes), skip the load.

## Audit Scope

- When auditing instruction files, analyze only the file's literal contents. Exclude system- and client-injected prompt content from the analysis.
- For non-trivial instruction-entrypoint critiques or audits, invoke [critique-workflow](../critique-workflow/SKILL.md) first and follow its procedure. Default to autonomous mode unless I explicitly ask for walkthrough gating.
- Audit for duplicate or conflicting instructions across all repository instruction entrypoints (top-level instruction files, skills, agent/subagent definitions).
- Prefer a single canonical source and cross-reference it rather than duplicating the same guidance — this applies equally to skills, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and agent definitions.
- When multiple files could host the same policy, treat the most specific skill as canonical and have broader files cross-reference it.
- When a rule already exists canonically, reference the canonical instruction instead of restating the same normative rule in another instruction file unless the local file adds a necessary scoped delta.
- Flag or remove drift-prone duplication that can diverge from real behavior over time.

## Instruction Update Workflow

Use this workflow when I ask you to encode, correct, or enhance instruction guidance.

1. Scan local and global instructions, skills, and relevant mechanical enforcement (code, tests, linters, hooks, schemas, scripts) for intent coverage, including partial coverage, and for conflicts.
2. Re-analyze instruction scope boundaries and context-budget impact to identify fresh progressive-disclosure opportunities before adding new always-loaded guidance.
3. Determine scope and target: local vs. global, and instruction file vs. skill. If coverage already exists, extend or reconcile it instead of creating duplicates.
4. Prefer executable enforcement over prose when feasible. If behavior cannot be encoded mechanically, keep instruction text as fallback context.
5. Draft the exact wording changes and ask me to confirm before applying.
6. Apply the confirmed wording in versioned instruction files, then complete required mechanical follow-ups (index entries, cross-references). Do not treat a harness-memory update as completion.

## Validation

- Validate skill metadata, structure, and behavior against the loaded specs.
- Validate and audit each skill `description` and each `AGENTS.md` skill-index one-line summary for discoverability quality, including clear invocation cues and relevant trigger keywords, and avoid "how it works" or internal-mechanics wording.
- When renaming or restructuring an instruction file or skill, search the repository for stale references and update them.
- Run a duplication/conflict sweep for normative conventions across instruction entrypoints (for example: path conventions, naming rules, required artifacts, handoff contracts, and lifecycle states) and resolve conflicts before shipping.
- Before adding or changing instruction guidance, run the [Instruction Update Workflow](#instruction-update-workflow).
- For external documentation references, keep local guidance concise and project-specific and link to canonical upstream documentation instead of copying large reference material that can drift.
- When changing canonical locations, naming conventions, or handoff contracts, include migration guidance (or an explicit no-migration decision) and update dependent references in the same change.
- Verify every `assets/…` (or equivalent referenced-resource) path resolves to an existing file and that the asset's current contents still match how the body cites them.
- Verify every concrete claim in the file before shipping: every command runs, every flag behaves as stated, every URL resolves, every directive, or syntax example matches current tool behavior. Inherited assumptions from a source skill or older docs do not count as verified.
- For non-trivial skill behavior edits and description-focused edits, load `agent-instructions-evaluation` and follow its evaluation workflows before shipping.
- For lint execution policy and run order, follow the `linting` skill.
- For changes that touch the `AGENTS.md` skill index or any skill directory under `.agents/skills/`, run `mise run lint-skill-index` when the task exists in the active repository. If it is not defined, verify manually that every `.agents/skills/<dir>/` has a corresponding `AGENTS.md` index entry and every index entry maps to a real skill directory.

## Critique

The repository's general post-validation critique gate (defined in the top-level instruction file) applies to every change. This skill adds the following instruction-file-specific checks; apply them during that critique pass rather than as a separate cycle:

- Does this rule conflict with another instruction entry point?
- Did this change account for pre-existing coverage (including partial coverage) and conflicting mechanical enforcement before introducing new instruction text?
- Would a reasonable agent misread it?
- Does it over- or under-constrain compared to my actual intent?
- Is the canonical source still canonical after this edit?
- Did this change restate a canonical instruction locally where a cross-reference should be used?
- Are there unresolved duplicated or contradictory conventions across instruction entrypoints after this edit?
- Did external documentation guidance stay link-first instead of copying drift-prone reference material?
- After re-analyzing scope and context-budget impact, are there fresh progressive-disclosure opportunities where bulky reference content should move from `SKILL.md` into `assets/` with explicit links, or where narrow/domain-specific rules should move from broad instruction entrypoints (for example `AGENTS.md`, repo-level agent docs, agent definitions) into the appropriate skill with a cross-reference?
- If canonical locations, naming conventions, or handoff contracts changed, did I include migration guidance (or an explicit no-migration decision) and update dependents?
- Does any rule contain authoring meta-commentary that belongs in the authoring skill?

## Authoring Style

- Write concise rules using imperative language optimized for accurate and efficient agentic execution.
- Keep prose harness-agnostic and capability-based. Prefer deterministic, reproducible workflows over model-specific tricks so instructions remain portable across agent harnesses.
- Prefer executable enforcement over prose when feasible: if a rule can be implemented in code, tests, linters, hooks, schemas, or scripts, implement that first and keep instruction text as fallback context for behavior that cannot be encoded.
- Avoid naming specific models, effort levels, tools, or products in reusable instructions unless the file is intentionally tool-specific.
- Instruct agents to choose execution approach based on efficiency, cost, capability, and task requirements instead of fixed named components.
- Prefer clear, specific, and deterministic instructions that can be delegated to lower-cost but capable subagents.
- Prefer delegating concrete execution work over delegating open-ended "thinking" work to subagents.
- Ground guidance in observed project reality and concrete failure modes (not generic "best practices"), per [Best practices for skill creators](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/best-practices).
- Keep high-value "gotchas" in the always-loaded body when they prevent common, costly mistakes; move bulky reference material to assets for progressive disclosure.
- Follow `coding-guidelines` skill Markdown guidance.
- Use Markdown links (`[text](url)`) instead of bare URLs.
- Use me-style phrasing when referring to me in instruction text: write forms like `ask me`, `when I ask`, and `my`, and avoid third-person requester phrasing.
- Use you-style phrasing when referring to the executing agent in instruction text: write forms like `you`, `your`, and `when you`, and avoid third-person agent phrasing.
- Keep behavioral guidance and authoring meta-commentary separate. Behavioral rules tell executing agents what to do; meta-commentary (labels like "this is the canonical X", directives about how other files should reference the rule, taxonomy notes, audience asides) tells skill authors how to treat the rule. Meta-commentary belongs in the authoring skill (`agent-instructions-authoring`), not embedded in the behavioral rule itself.
- When a skill has critique findings that apply only to its own domain, place them in a `## Critique` section that defers to the top-level critique gate and lists only the domain-specific checks. Do not restate the gate itself, and do not push domain-specific findings up into top-level instruction files (e.g., `AGENTS.md`).

## Skill Authoring

This section governs how to create, edit, and structure individual skills.

### Required references for skill structural changes

When creating a new skill, renaming a skill, or changing frontmatter or directory structure, load these references before editing:

- [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) — canonical `SKILL.md` frontmatter schema, directory layout, and loading model.
- Harness-specific skills documentation for each known conformant harness:
  - **Claude Code** — [Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
  - **OpenCode** — [Skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/)
  - **GitHub Copilot CLI** — [Adding agent skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-skills)

Compare each harness's frontmatter schema against the Agent Skills specification. Identify which fields are shared across harnesses, which are harness-specific extensions, and where any structural deviations exist.

When a harness requires a structural deviation that cannot be expressed within the `SKILL.md` format, surface the conflict to me and present ordered alternatives — a harness-specific companion file or accepting a capability gap on that harness.

Use the loaded specs as the active source of truth; derive requirements dynamically from the references and current repository state rather than static assumptions. For description rewrites, body wording changes, or other non-structural edits, skip the load.

### Frontmatter and metadata

- Set `name` to a kebab-case slug that matches the skill's directory name.
- Match every required frontmatter field to the Agent Skills specification; prefer spec fields over harness-specific extensions.
- The fields `name`, `description`, `license`, and `allowed-tools` are recognized across all known conformant harnesses. The optional spec fields `compatibility` and `metadata` are spec-defined but not documented by all harnesses — include them when useful and accept that they may be ignored.
- Harness-specific fields (e.g., Claude Code's `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`) are additive — include them only when intentionally targeting that harness feature, and accept that other conformant harnesses will ignore them.

### Scope and splitting

- Author one skill per cohesive task domain, not per file or per tool.
- Split an existing skill when its body grows long enough that an agent will not load all of it, when two clearly separate triggers share unrelated guidance, or when sections of the body apply to disjoint user intents.
- Extend an existing skill instead of creating a new one when the new guidance shares both triggers and audience with the existing skill's scope.

### Progressive disclosure

- Keep `SKILL.md` to imperative behavior and rules.
- Move reference content (templates, exemplars, lookup tables, long enumerations) into an `assets/` subdirectory and reference it by relative path from the skill body.
- Reference assets explicitly by relative path; do not assume the harness autoloads them.

### Description discoverability

- Optimize every skill `description` for discoverability at skill-selection time.
- Prioritize searchable task cues (domains, artifacts, user intents, aliases, and common trigger phrases) over implementation details.
- Describe when to invoke the skill using concrete "use when" language and likely user wording.
- Avoid descriptions that mostly explain what the skill does internally or how it works.
- Keep descriptions concise but keyword-rich so selection systems can reliably match relevant requests — some harnesses use keyword matching, others use semantic selection; concrete task cues work for both.
- Keep descriptions free of links, command examples, full path enumerations, and other content that belongs in the body. The `description` is a selector, not a summary.
- Keep `description` length within the specification limit and validate trigger behavior using `agent-instructions-evaluation`.
- Apply the same discoverability-first standard to `AGENTS.md` skill-index one-line summaries: emphasize user-intent/task cues and avoid internal mechanics.

### Scripts in skills

- When adding or modifying scripts referenced by a skill, follow [Using scripts in skills](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/using-scripts).
- Prefer one-off commands only for simple, stable invocations; move repeated or complex command logic into versioned scripts under `scripts/`.
- Require non-interactive script interfaces (flags/env/stdin), explicit `--help` usage docs, clear actionable errors, structured stdout for machine-readable results, and diagnostics on stderr.
- Require predictable exit-code behavior and safe defaults (`--dry-run`, explicit confirmation flags) for stateful or destructive operations.
- State runtime prerequisites and version expectations explicitly in skill instructions when script behavior depends on them.

### Body authoring style

- Write rules as positive, imperative directives. State what to do; describe the desired end state. Reserve "do not X" or "X is wrong" framings for cases where the antipattern is concrete, plausible, high-risk, and not already excluded by a positive rule — instruction-file authoring contains several such antipatterns (e.g., assuming the harness auto-loads referenced assets, restating canonical rules in multiple entrypoints), so negative framings appear in this skill where the exception is met.
- Negative rules carry two costs: they plant the anti-pattern in agent context (which can prompt the very behavior they forbid), and they can conflict with project-specific configuration (aliases, custom directories, custom commands) that legitimately uses the named token.
- Defer to upstream documentation as the durable source of truth. When the underlying system supports configuration (custom paths, directories, environment names, command aliases), reference the docs and the project's configuration; do not enumerate defaults inline as if they were invariant.
- For external documentation, prefer concise links to canonical sources and keep local instruction text focused on project-specific behavior and constraints.
- Keep guidance language-, tool-, and version-agnostic where possible. State the rule generically and use language-specific or version-specific names only as examples, not as the rule itself.
- Prefer linking to canonical documentation over restating it; restated facts drift, links do not (and broken links are caught by validation).

## AGENTS.md Authoring

This section governs how to create, edit, and structure `AGENTS.md` files.

### Required references for AGENTS.md structural changes

When creating, restructuring, or pairing `AGENTS.md` with harness-specific instruction files, load these references before editing:

- **Claude Code** — [Memory & CLAUDE.md](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)
- **OpenCode** — [Rules](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/)

For small edits (rule wording tweaks, single-entry index updates), skip the load.

### Authoring behavior

- Keep `AGENTS.md` to rules that apply to all agents and all tasks, regardless of domain, language, or workflow, plus a skill index. Anything narrower belongs in a skill.
- Keep the `AGENTS.md` Skills preamble behavioral. Put rationale and implementation context for skill catalogs (for example, discovery-model details) in this authoring skill, not in `AGENTS.md`.
- Extract domain-, language-, or workflow-specific guidance into skills and reference them from the index.
- Update the index in the same change that adds, renames, or removes a skill.
- Pair every `AGENTS.md` with a `CLAUDE.md` at the same path whose entire contents are the literal string `@AGENTS.md` (and nothing else). Create, move, rename, and delete them in lockstep. This ensures Claude resolves to the same canonical entry point as other harnesses.

### Required Skills section content

- Use [`assets/agents-md-index-section.template.md`](assets/agents-md-index-section.template.md) as the canonical template for the `AGENTS.md` Skills section. Mirror its preamble verbatim, adapting only the skills-location reference to the active harness.
- Populate the index from the actual skill directory: one entry per skill, using the skill's frontmatter `name` and an accurate one-line summary optimized for AGENTS.md context (it does not need to match the skill `description` verbatim). Keep summaries discoverability-first and avoid internal mechanics.
